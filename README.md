# scREAD protocol

This is the repository for the *STAR protocols* manuscript: **Use of scREAD to Explore and Analyze Single-cell and Single-nucleus RNA-Seq data for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease**. 

The protocol is baed on **scREAD** (single-cell RNA-Seq database for Alzheimer's Disease). It is a first-of-its-kind database to provide comprehensive analysis results of all the existing single-cell RNA-Seq and single-nucleus RNA-Seq data of Alzheimer's Disease in the public domain. The database is freely available at: [https://bmbls.bmi.osumc.edu/scread/](https://bmbls.bmi.osumc.edu/scread/)

The original scREAD paper was published in *iScience*: [scREAD: A Single-Cell RNA-Seq Database for Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220309664)

## How to use the protocols?

- Calculating overlapping DEGs from the same cell type across datasets (Optional section 6 in the manuscript)
  - Run /overlapping_genes/overlap.rmd locally
  - Use Google Colab version: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lInXa6jD4yc7RGJc0EWDfy5NNoXT1qye?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lInXa6jD4yc7RGJc0EWDfy5NNoXT1qye?usp=sharing) 
- Optional section 7: Running scREAD backend analysis workflow locally (Optional section 7 in the manuscript)
  - open [workflow readme](https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/scread-protocol/tree/master/workflow)
